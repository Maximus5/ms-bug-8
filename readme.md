# Vivid demonstration of autohidden TaskBar behavior

This test application creates standard and simple window.
When you maximize it it's easy to see where client area is located.

It's OK when TaskBar is **not** autohidden, but when it is we may see
that one-two pixels of client area are obscured by TaskBar.
